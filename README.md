This repository represents my first step into the world of open-source collaboration, designed specifically to create a simple, secure, and easy-to-deploy ticketing system based on the open-source tool **Zammad**, hosted on an **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** server (remote or local), and seamlessly integrated with **Microsoft 365**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements & Prerequisites

1. **Remote or Local Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Server**
   - Clean installation accessible via root SSH.
2. **Domain Name (Namecheap assumed)**
   - A record must point to your server's IP.
3. **Jenkins CI/CD**
   - Handles deployment and injects secrets such as SSH keys, domain details and DockerHub credentials.
   - Prepare the Jenkins host for SSH as described in [Jenkins SSH Setup on Host Machine](docs/first-run.md#-jenkins-ssh-setup-on-host-machine).
4. **Azure Tenant with Admin Access**
   - Required for Microsoft 365 shared mailboxes, Entra ID authentication and Teams/SharePoint integrations.

## üéØ Project Vision

My name is Juraj, and at 31, I've decided to dive into a journey of learning, collaboration, and building something meaningful for myself and other small to mid-sized businesses. As an entrepreneur managing a mid-sized business, I'm often frustrated by the high costs associated with running custom software. My goal is to leverage the power of open-source solutions and streamline deployment with a CI/CD pipeline, enabling even those with limited technical experience (like myself!) to deploy and manage a robust ticketing solution efficiently.

I believe integrating the **Zammad** ticketing system with **Microsoft 365** is crucial due to its widespread adoption, robust security, and versatile tools (Outlook, SharePoint, Teams, etc.). This integration aims to enhance functionality, reduce complexity, and leverage existing organizational structures like Microsoft Groups and permissions.

Ultimately, I envision this project as a foundation‚Äînot just for ticketing‚Äîbut potentially evolving into a customizable workflow automation platform tailored to individual company needs. Additionally, integrating a workflow automation tool like **n8n** in the future would be extremely powerful, allowing companies to create intricate, automated workflows that respond dynamically to various triggers and actions.

Another exciting future vision is integrating structured document handling capabilities. This would allow various documents uploaded into tickets or workflows to be processed systematically, enhancing functionality such as customer complaints handling and enabling advanced automated responses or actions based on document content.

In the longer term, I'm enthusiastic about exploring integrations with **AI agents and MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, creating a highly responsive and intelligent system that dynamically supports business operations, customer interactions, and internal processes. The ultimate goal is to empower businesses by providing meaningful, actionable automation that evolves alongside their needs.

## üîë Goals

* **Easy Deployment:** Deploy Zammad on an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server using Jenkins CI/CD.
* **Secure Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with Microsoft 365 for authentication, email, and other productivity tools.
* **Cost-Effective Solution:** Offer businesses a practical alternative to expensive commercial solutions.
* **Learning and Growth:** Document extensively to foster learning and enable contributors of all skill levels to participate.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Zammad:** Open-source ticketing system.
* **Docker Compose:** Containerize and simplify deployments.
* **Jenkins:** Automate deployments with an existing CI/CD pipeline.
* **Microsoft 365:** OAuth authentication, email integration, Teams and SharePoint integration.
* **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Server:** Remote or local host machine.
* **n8n (Future integration):** Workflow automation tool for custom integrations and actions.
* **Structured Document Handling (Future integration):** Systematic processing and management of uploaded documents.
* **AI Agents & MCP (Future integration):** Intelligent, dynamic workflow automation and customer interaction enhancements.

## üöß Next Steps & Contribution

* Set up initial Docker Compose stack.
* Configure Jenkins pipeline and deployment scripts.
* Develop robust documentation for ease of use.
* Enhance and test Microsoft 365 integration features.

Contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, create a feature branch and open a pull request when you're ready. You can also open issues to discuss ideas or problems.
