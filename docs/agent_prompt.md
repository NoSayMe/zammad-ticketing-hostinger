> **Prerequisite:** Familiarize yourself with the [Requirements & Prerequisites](README/index.md#-requirements--prerequisites) before contributing.

You are contributing to an open-source project designed to create a secure, modular, and easy-to-deploy ticketing and automation platform based on Zammad and Docker. This project is being actively built to serve small to mid-sized organizations and educational purposes.

⚠️ Above all, this project is **documentation-first**. Every feature or service must be accompanied by clear, human-readable documentation that explains:
- What it does
- How to install/deploy it
- How to verify it works
- How to troubleshoot it
- (Optionally) How it works internally

This includes Markdown-based files in `/docs`, and optionally a `/wiki` containerized page for UI-based browsing (to be defined).

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

- A **secure**, **cost-effective**, and **scalable** ticketing solution
- Fully deployable via **Jenkins CI/CD pipeline** to an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server
- All components run in **Docker containers** with isolated roles
- Clean and modular structure: one service = one Dockerfile
- Seamless integration with **Microsoft 365**, **NGINX + Certbot**, and more
- Emphasis on **education**, **documentation**, and **community usability**
- Clear roadmap for future integrations:
  - n8n (workflow automation)
  - AI Agents (via MCP)
  - Structured document handling (PDF/Office parsing)
  - Web-based admin panel (/wiki or /dashboard)

## 🛠️ Core Components

You are responsible for creating, containerizing, and documenting the following:

| Component        | Description   |
|------------------|--------------|
| `zammad`         | Main ticketing system   |
| `postgresql`     | Relational database backend for Zammad   |
| `elasticsearch`  | Search indexing backend   |
| `nginx`          | TLS termination and reverse proxy   |
| `certbot`        | HTTPS certificate issuance and renewal   |
| `homepage`       | Simple static `/` HTML landing page with links to tools   |
| `jenkins`        | CI/CD deployment automation   |
| `docs/`          | Markdown documentation for each area   |

---

## 🔁 Pipeline & Credentials

The project is deployed using a **Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline**, configured to:
- Pull from GitHub via webhook (`main` branch)
- Build Docker images
- Push to DockerHub
- SSH into remote VPS
- Run `deploy-script.sh` to bring up the stack

All sensitive values (IP, SSH key, domain, registry, SMTP) are passed via **Jenkins credential bindings**.

---

## 📚 Documentation Requirements

For every deployed or integrated component, you must:
- Create a dedicated `.md` file under `docs/`
- Clearly explain:
  - What the service/component does
  - How it’s deployed (including Docker, volumes, ports)
  - What to check to confirm it’s working properly
  - What to try if it fails (logs, container health, restart tips)
  - External links to docs, if relevant
- Use real examples, and plain English
- Prefer visual verification (e.g., accessible URL) and CLI checks (`docker ps`, `docker logs`, etc.)

---

## 🌐 (Optional) Containerized Wiki

We plan to host a `/wiki` or `/docs` page accessible via the domain, rendered from the Markdown files in `docs/`.

This may use:
- `docsify`, `mkdocs`, `jekyll`, or other static site generators
- Containerized UI hosted alongside other services

---

## ⚙️ Service Integrity is Mandatory

✅ Every service must include:
- Persistent volume definition and mounting
- Health check and troubleshooting steps in docs
- Instructions for restarting or reconfiguring
- Proper reverse proxy config if accessed over web

---

## ✅ Deliverables Checklist for Each Service

For each new component (Zammad, NGINX, Certbot, etc.), the following must be delivered:
- [ ] `services/<name>/Dockerfile`
- [ ] `docker-compose.yaml` service definition
- [ ] Mounted volumes defined and documented
- [ ] Any configs (e.g., nginx.conf) stored in `services/<name>/`
- [ ] Markdown file under `/docs/<name>.md`
- [ ] Updated homepage `/` index.html with relevant link (if applicable)
- [ ] Working in end-to-end CI/CD deployment

---

## 🔐 Credentials (in Jenkins)

| ID                          | Purpose                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `github-credentials`        | SSH access to repo              |
| `dockerhub-credentials`     | DockerHub push login            |
| `docker-registry`           | Registry namespace (`nosayme`) |
| `ssh-remote-server-hostinger-deploy` | Root SSH key for VPS |
| `remote-hostinger-deploy-ip`| IP of VPS                       |
| `remote-user`               | User account on VPS             |
| `remote-hostinger-domain`   | Domain pointed to VPS           |

## 🔐 Credential Management Policy

1. **All Paid Services Must Use Jenkins Secrets** – any credential for paid or sensitive services (Microsoft 365, DockerHub, domain certificates, remote SSH) is injected at runtime using Jenkins credential bindings. These values must never be committed to the repository.
2. **Secret Centralization** – Jenkins is the only approved location for storing OAuth credentials, DockerHub logins, Certbot email, SSH keys, and domain/IP details. Do not store these in `.env` files or echo them in logs. Reference them by credential ID in the `Jenkinsfile`.
3. **Documentation Format** – every guide should include the block below to remind contributors that secrets are managed by Jenkins:

```
> **⚠️ Sensitive Keys**
> All required keys and secrets for this integration are injected securely via Jenkins and are not stored in this repository.
```

---

## 🚧 Work Strategy

Each step/task (service, feature, integration) is handled as a discrete documented unit.

Work in the following order:
1. Implement functionality
2. Verify service is functional (in container and deployed)
3. Document setup + verification + troubleshooting
4. Commit in small, self-contained steps

---

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ Jenkins CI/CD pipeline is working
- ✅ Domain name and IP set up as credentials
- ✅ NGINX + `/` homepage serve is functional
- 🔧 Zammad service being containerized
- 🔧 Certbot auto-renew still pending verification
- 🔧 Proper documentation needed for each service

---

Continue with the next step by checking the `/docs` directory and creating/expanding a service if it’s not complete.
