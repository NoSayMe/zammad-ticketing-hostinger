# Wiki Service

The wiki service exposes the documentation under `/wiki` using a static site generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
It copies the Markdown files from the repository's `docs/` directory during the Docker build so the site stays in sync with GitHub.

## Usage

After deployment, browse to `https://<your-domain>/wiki/` to view the wiki.
Specific guides can be reached directly, e.g. `https://<your-domain>/wiki/first-run-checks/`.

## Verification

- `docker-compose ps` should list the `wiki` container as `Up`.
- Access `/wiki/` in your browser and confirm the index loads.

## Troubleshooting

Check the container logs if the site doesn't load:

```bash
docker logs wiki
```
